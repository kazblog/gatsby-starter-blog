Currently I try to create POST request to railsAPI with Vue. I can do with GET request but post request is another level like I need basic JS knowledge to get that done.. and I don’t have one. Maybe it going to be stack forever if I keep doing same things and I thought ‘why dont’t you go back to basics and come back?’ So from now on, I’m gonna meke some project with only JS(TS) and react. We’ll see how it goes.
